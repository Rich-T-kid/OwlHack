#.csv file would be autogenerated every hour from on-field sensors that generate the data.
#SeismicWaveAmplitude_nm is the seismic wave amplitude in nanometers.
#SeismicFrequency_Hz is the seismic frequency in hertz.
#SeismicVelocity_m_s is the seismic velocity in meters per second.
#ElectricalChange_uV is the electrical change in microvolts.
#GroundWaterChange_m is the ground water change in meters.
#AnimalActivityDuration_h is the length of animal activity in minutes.

#Seismic Frequencies:
#High-frequency waves (1–20 Hz): Typically associated with smaller earthquakes and are the first to arrive (P-waves).
#Intermediate-frequency waves (0.1–1 Hz): Can be associated with moderate to large earthquakes.
#Low-frequency waves (<0.1 Hz): Generally associated with large to very large earthquakes and can travel long distances.
